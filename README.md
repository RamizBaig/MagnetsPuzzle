For python code/.txt:

# MagnetsPuzzle
the main function solveMagnets requires 5 inputs to run:
a 2d array of single chracter strings of T, B, L, R (top, bottom, left, right) representing the sides of dominoes
and 4 arrays of integers that represent the number of 'poles' of the magnet that belong in a row or col.
top and left specify positive poles, right an bottom specify negative poles
a value of -1 means that there it doesnt matter how many go in the row or col

text file containing many test cases now added ranfinging from 4x4 to 16x16
currently only fast enough to solve 1 or 2 out of 4 16x16

rust, smalltalk, elixir, haskell have own testing classes
